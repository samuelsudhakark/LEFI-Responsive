			<b>Matt. 7:17-20</b>

			<p>&quot;Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt
			tree bringeth forth evil fruit.&quot; Verse 17. Everybody knows this. Have you ever gone
			and eaten margosa fruit? Margosa fruit is very bitter. No one thinks they are as sweet as
			grapes. The margosa tree produces bitter fruits. &quot;A good tree cannot bring forth evil
			fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not
			forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits ye shall
			know them.&quot; Verse 18, 19 &amp; 20. By now our fruits should have filled the world;
			Punjab, Tibet, China and Russia. But somehow, we have not become perfect in love. You know
			the bottle-neck. In most of our lives, love is the bottle-neck. There is not an outpouring
			love. Please note, that love and holiness go together. The Bible says, &quot;He that
			abideth in love abideth in God.&quot; We have unlimited opportunities to love. But we have
			to learn to love as Jesus loves. Sometimes, we get very angry with the wrong-doer. That is
			our natural response. What is God&#146;s answer to the wrong-doer? The Cross. What an
			answer! Any wrong-doer when he comes to the Cross, he is dumb-founded. His self-defence
			and self justification cease. We do not have such love; we do not exercise such love; we
			do not use this answer. We believe in the might of our own arms and our own words. No, the
			Cross is the answer. There is so much wickedness around us- so much that should not be
			there. What is the answer? What is God&#146;s answer? He can throw us off into the fire-
			every one of us, me, you, everyone. But what is His answer? &quot;I have taken your sins
			on Me.&quot; I find that very hard to do. My natural zeal makes me feel very angry at sin.
			But what is Jesus&#146; answer? &quot;Father forgive them.&quot; When they were nailing
			Him to the Cross He prayed, &quot;Father, forgive them.&quot; When they were nailing Him
			to the Cross He prayed, &quot;Father, forgive them.&quot; If we also were like that, our
			fruit would fill the earth. My dear people, let us not be talkers. That is why Jesus
			closed His Sermon on the Mount like this: &quot;Not everyone that saith unto me, Lord,
			Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my father
			which is in heaven.&quot;</p>

			<p>Let us not be afraid of God&#146;s will. We have many natural fears.
			Fear comes because of lack of faith. And out of that fear comes disobedience. Jesus
			completes His Sermon on the Mount on the note of obedience. &quot;I have told you all
			these things. If you do them, you will be like one built on the rock, if you do not do
			these, you will have a great fall.&quot; Why should we fall? Why should we fail in love?
			Why should we allow the devil to bring all fears and unfaith? See, God has surrounded us
			with works of faith. But still we can entertain fears and work negatively. And that will
			only make us go far away from God. But, when we obey, in effect we are saying, &quot;My
			Father, I know, you take care of me. I know, you have got more than adequate provision for
			me - more than my needs. I will not listen to my natural fears or to the world. I will
			look to you.&quot;</p>
