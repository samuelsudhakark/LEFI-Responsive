			<b>Exodus 31:1-8</b>

			<p>&quot;I am the God of thy father.&quot; God knows our fathers. God knows
			your father, God knew Moses’ father. &quot;I am the God of Abraham, Isaac and
			Jacob.&quot; Why was God so particular to mention Moses’ father? God knew
			Moses’ father was a man of God, full of faith. By faith the parents of Moses
			hid him three months against the law of Pharaoh. If they were not people of
			faith, Moses would have been meat for the crocodiles. There are many crocodiles
			in this world which destroy the souls of children. But many parents are
			careless. Many children are in the power of the devil because of the
			carelessness of the parents. Their one desire is to gather money in this world.</p>

			<p>Moses’ father was a praying man. Instead of being thrown into the river <st1:place>Nile</st1:place>,
			the prayer of his father threw him into the <st1:place><st1:PlaceType>palace</st1:PlaceType>
			 of <st1:PlaceName>Pharaoh</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>. It was a place where
			the best learning of those times was available.</p>

			<p>Satan is reigning in this world. His one desire is to see you destroyed.
			John <st1:time Minute="10" Hour="10">10:10</st1:time> &quot;The thief cometh
			not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to destroy: I am come that they might
			have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.&quot; Satan wants to
			destroy your children. He wants to destroy them during their teens. When their
			faith in Christ is destroyed they are as good as dead. When those who do not
			study the Word of God are the elders of churches, faith cannot grow there. <span
			class=GramE>So children’s faith is destroyed before they grow into manhood and
			before they enter married life.</span></p>

			<p>God wanted a deliverer to lead <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
			He looked for a home where there was faith and where there was righteousness.
			He wanted parents with faith who prayed for their children every day. God found
			one family where both the parents believed in Him. The eldest son and the
			eldest daughter believed in God. Here was an atmosphere where a deliverer could
			grow. The father, mother and sister and brother covered the new born infant
			with prayer. They gave the babe more than food and physical care. They gave him
			faith and righteousness. God heard their prayer. He preserved the babe. God
			also gave him a good earthly education. God answered their prayer further by
			continuing his education after he had learnt all that there was to learn in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Egypt</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
			He was now in new surroundings where sheep were his companions. It was a
			wilderness. In similar places John the Baptist, Elijah and other deep men of
			God were educated. The proximity of men of unfaith is a great contamination.
			Here in the wilderness, God educated him. You receive your highest degree when
			you are educated by God. God said, &quot;Come on, Moses, I remember your
			father’s prayers. They are all before me. I remember, I remember the promise I
			made to Abraham. I have seen the tears of my people. I am God and I am bound by
			my covenant. Remove your shoes. This is a holy place. A man perfectly educated
			by the Holy Spirit finds a holy place at hand. God visited him and spoke to
			him. He anointed him and gave him many signs to convince <st1:country-region><st1:place>Israel</st1:place></st1:country-region>
			that he had been sent by God.</p>
