			<h4 class="heading-align"><a name="1"></a>Daniel Meets Sundar Singh</h4>

			<p>When Daniel first heard of Sadhu Sundar Singh and of the marvellous
			manner in which God was speaking to him and leading him, he was greatly thrilled in his
			heart. At a time when he himself was proving the power of our unchangeable God, in his own
			life, Sundar Singh&#146;s experiences brought new inspiration and encouragement to his
			heart.</p>

			<p>When Christian leaders of both evangelical assemblies and Modernistic
			circles held, from their different viewpoints, that God will not speak today and that
			miracles will not happen now, Daniel would not agree with them. He knew, and he had begun
			to prove for himself that Jesus is the same, 'Yesterday, today, for ever&quot;. Heb.13-8.
			'Why will not God use us today as He used Peter and Paul?&quot;, was a burning question in
			his heart. With all his heart he maintained, that God will work today as He did in the
			Bible days.</p>

			<p>Sadhu Sundar Singh now appeared on the scene as the answer to Daniel's
			deep longings. His convictions were greatly confirmed by his hearing, seeing and meeting
			Sadhu Sundar Singh.</p>

			<p>When he heard of this Christ-like man of God he asked God to bring him
			to the place where he was studying. Daniel was still at Kakinada at that time. When he
			heard that Sadhu Sundar Singh was going to visit Kakinada, he was so thrilled at all the
			wonderful possibilities of this visit, that he set out on a cycle with a supply of
			handbills announcing Sundar Singh&#146;s meetings and distributed thern. to many.
			Moreover, he contacted every one of his classmates personally and invited them to the
			meetings of Sundar Singh. After hearing Sundar Singh, one of Daniel's Hindu classmates
			said to him, &quot;Daniel, I am no longer a Hindu. I am a Christian&quot;.</p>

			<p>Sadhu Sundar Singh himself had no knowledge at all of the devout young
			disciple Daniel. There were many big men who wanted to meet Sundar Singh and speak with
			him. Further, he had a demanding schedule of meetings, besides the long hours that he
			spent in prayer, which he zealously guarded from all intrusions and interviews.</p>

			<p>Thus the chances of Daniel obtaining. an interview with this great man
			of God, were very slim. Sundar Singh&#146;s interpreter undertook to introduce Daniel to
			him. At first, Sundar Singh had thought that Daniel was just another of the many curious
			and enthusiastic people, that clamoured to meet him.. It was not long however, before
			Sundar Singh sensed and understood that Daniel was quite another person, from what he had
			supposed him to be and straightway began to treat Daniel with great tenderness and love.</p>

			<p>When Sundar Singh moved on to the next place where meetings were
			scheduled for him, Vizag, he invited Daniel to travel with him and to live with him.
			Daniel felt that he was totally unworthy to move so closely with this unique man of God,
			that he only accepted the invitation to Iive in the same house with Sundar Singh and
			declined to eat with him. This experience of living with Sundar Singh left a deep
			impression upon Daniel.</p>

			<p>Daniel even wanted to go further afield with Sundar Singh but that was
			not God's will for Daniel. He even said to Sundar Singh, &quot;1 will go with you to Tibet
			and die as a martyr for Christ.&quot; Sundar Singh&#146;s reply was, &quot;It is easy to
			die as a martyr for Christ but to live for Christ is hard.&quot; How resoundingly true are
			these words!</p>

			<p>Sundar Singh further told Daniel that God would use him amongst young
			people and students. True to what Sundar Singh had said, all through his long ministry of
			fifty years, God used Daniel to bring many students and young people to Christ.</p>

			<p>In parting, Sundar Singh gave Daniel his shawl or blanket as a token of
			his<b> </b>love. Sundar Singh had few belongings besides the clothes that he had on. He<b>
			</b>carried nothing but a Bible and a shawl that served to protect him from the severe
			cold of the remote regions, such as the Himalayan heights, which he used to traverse in
			his missionary journeys. This shawl he gave to Daniel. People were quick to note the
			Biblical parallel to this and said half-seriously, &quot;The mantle of Sundar Singh has
			fallen on Daniel.&quot;</p>

			<p>When Daniel returned home with the blanket presented to him, after
			taking his leave of Sundar Singh, he found his brother critically ill, stricken by double
			Pneumonia. He was practically given up for dead. The doctors had given him up and the
			relatives had retired from the patient's side and were quietly shedding tears. The pallor
			of death was clearly upon his brother&#146;s face. Daniel went into the room where his
			dying brother lay motionless. He knelt down and prayed. After prayer he covered his
			brother with the blanket which Sundar Singh had given him. A remarkable turn came over the
			patient almost immediately and the Lord healed him.</p>

			<p>The simple and sacrificial life that Sundar Singh led, his self-denial
			and his complete abandonment to the will of God, were lessons that Daniel absorbed into
			his life.</p>

			<p>Sundar Singh continued to pray for Daniel. Although their paths never
			crossed again, when Sundar Singh met a mutual friend, years after, he enquired after
			Daniel and told how he still prayed for him.</p>
			
			<hr>
			
			<h4 class="heading-align"><a name="2"></a>Revival Fans Out</h4>

			<p>After the conclusion of the six days of meetings at Repalle, Bro. Daniel
			returned to Madras. He had the comfort of knowing that at least there was a missionary who
			co-operated cent percent with him, on the spot, to continue to water the seed which was
			sown and to encourage the souls that were converted.</p>

			<p>From the standpoint of the mission however, now that the meetings had
			concluded, Bro. Daniel had no further responsibility in that area. It so often happened
			that the devil managed to so manoeuvre the top committees of the missions, that soon after
			revival broke out, the missionary who knew well the field and partook in the movement and
			perhaps himself received a great blessing by obtaining anew a broken and contrite spirit,
			would be transferred away from the scene of the revival. This naturally was a grievous
			blow to the work time and again.</p>

			<p>This godly missionary Mr. John C. Peery who had co-operated
			wholeheartedly with Bro. Daniel, did not remain long at Repalle, to follow the progress of
			the revival and to call for more revival meetings in that area.</p>

			<p>Not long after he returned from Repalle to Madras, Bro. Daniel began to
			receive letters conveying to him the great and mighty things that were being done in the
			Name of the Lord Jesus by the young converts of the revival. These reports brought news of
			several happenings that were quite unique and seemed almost unbelievable. The situation
			called for an unbiased investigation and true appraisal, whether these things were really
			so.</p>

			<p>Bro. Daniel found it necessary to undertake a short tour of some of the
			spots to which the original revival had fanned out. What he witnessed and saw thrilled his
			soul and fired his faith to undertake measures, to build up the young converts, so that
			the revival may not weaken, but spread forth to new areas, winning unreached multitudes
			for Jesus.</p>

			<p>A simple woman, a petty roadside seller of food grains, narrated the
			following incident to Bro. Daniel. She had been converted, when after the revival meeting
			at Repalle, the flames of revival spread to this village of Penumudi. She sat by the
			roadside with a little basket of food grains, making no more than a bare existence through
			her trade. A stranger approached her and begged her for a handful of grains. Poor as she
			was, moved by compassion from her newly converted heart, she did what she could hardly
			afford to do. Filling one of her measures, she poured the grains into his cupped hands. On
			this, the stranger poured back the grains into her basket, where the level of grains was
			very low. As the grains poured from his hands, her basket filled rapidly, until it was
			nearly brimming over. As she lifted up her eyes in wonder and praise, suddenly recognizing
			her Saviour and Lord, He disappeared.</p>

			<p>There were many others who spoke of healing and other miraculous
			happenings. But the one most significant factor was that there was a mighty Spirit of
			prayer upon the people. And as they prayed, the blessing multiplied. The atmosphere in
			that village seemed to be charged with the presence of God.</p>

			<p>Little children too came under the power of God and were converted. They
			too began to exercise faith and the fears that hitherto dominated their little minds, no
			longer held them in thraldom. While many were being healed of the venomous bites of snakes
			and the extremely painful stings of scorpions, which. abound in profusion in many Indian
			villages, the children also began to prove God's power. Bro. Daniel was told that little
			children were found playing with scorpions and they would not sting them. While we do not
			advocate our readers experimenting with scorpions, yet it must be remembered, that when
			God begins to work, several things which are totally contrary to the laws of nature, do
			happen.</p>

			<p>The missions generally had no machinery to deal with a situation like
			this. It so often happened that the local pastors and sometimes the missionaries too, were
			themselves converted in the revival. Being babes in Christ, they felt incompetent to feed
			the other newly converted people with the Word of God. In some cases, their theology of a
			life-time had to be dumped on the garbage heap. The theology of unbelief had no relevance,
			in the face of revival, where God Himself was seen at work. The mission authorities in
			most cases, therefore, exhibited little enthusiasm for follow-up measures of any sort to 
			build the young converts in their new found faith.</p>

			<p>An exigency like this called for immediate remedial measures. As the
			converts of the revival multiplied and cried to be fed with God's Word, Bro. Daniel called
			for special meetings at Bro. John's village, Penumudi. Penumudi is an insignificant little
			village of Guntur District, tucked away by the broad banks of the mighty river Kistna.</p>

			<p>It being the summer vacation, Bro. Daniel took his children also to the
			meetings. Young as they were, they were enriched greatly by being eyewitnesses of God's
			great works.</p>

			<p>In two or three days, there was a fresh outbreak of revival at the
			meetings. Many had gathered from outlying villages and the early converts from a criminal
			tribe called the Yerukulas, were also present. The scenes of revival were so vivid and awe
			inspiring that they can never be forgotten by those who witnessed those mighty works of
			God.</p>

			<p>People betook themselves to the sands of the river banks or the shady
			groves, to give themselves to prayer. The present writer who was deeply involved in
			personal work, was kept busy through the day and late into the night, with repenting
			souls, who were under powerful conviction of sin. Some were felled to the ground by the
			power of God and could not even rise to their knees. And one sturdy man was found to be
			blinded and could not open his eyes. There were people there from other areas too, from
			across the river. There was no noise or unnecessary publicity generated by the revival nor
			were there found any incongruous incidents or events taking place. There was a deep sense
			of the awfulness and abominableness of sin. God was palpably felt moving and working in
			the midst.</p>

			<p>A widow told of how God had used her late husband who was one of the
			early converts of revival, before his death. &quot;A little boy was found missing in the
			village,&quot; she said. &quot;A frantic search was made and his body was found to be
			floating in a canal. My husband began to pray for the boy to be raised to life. The
			unbelieving relatives of the boy clamoured to take away the body for burial. But my
			husband would not give up. And as he prayed, the boy sneezed and opened his eyes.&quot;
			Events such as this no doubt produced a profound effect, upon the non-Christian population
			who have become habituated to the ill-informed view that Christianity is the whiteman's
			religion.</p>

			<p>God began to speak even to some of the Hindu landlords. Their turning to
			the Lord produced a near sensation in those parts, as the wealthier Hindus of those parts
			have always shied away from Christianity, as the religion of the lowest rung of society,
			the untouchables*. The prevailing feeling among the proud rich has therefore been, that to
			turn to Christ, was to bring an awful reproach upon their families and to debase
			themselves in the eyes of society. This iron-bound caste exclusiveness began to be
			breached by the revival.</p>

			<p>* Now the laws against the practice of untouchability, are being.
			half-heartedly enforced and it is against law to treat the poor casteless people, as
			outcastes.</p>

			<p>Bro. Daniel had the special gift of being able to come down to the level
			of these simple and rustic people and teach them God's Word and the life of Christian
			discipline. These meetings at Penumudi continued annually for a few years, giving a great
			fillip to the work.</p>

			<hr>
			
			<h4 class="heading-align"><a name="3"></a>Call my Saints Together</h4>

			<p>While the revival fires began to burn and many souls were being
			transformed from their earlier lives of uncleanness, ungodliness and plain indifference
			towards the Lord Jesus, the question of feeding these young converts came to the fore. The
			solution to this vital question was not found through deliberations and consultations but
			through inspiration.</p>

			<p>One summer, not long after the early outpouring of God's spirit at
			Kakinada, Repalle, Vuyyuru and some other centres, God said to Bro. Daniel, &quot;Gather
			my saints together unto me, those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice&quot;.
			Psalm 50:5. Through this scripture the Lord indicated to Bro. Daniel that he should gather
			the converted people from these several areas, and give them an undisturbed season of
			waiting on God and feeding on His word. Bro. Daniel had never known a retreat on a scale
			in which God was planning.</p>

			<p>Now these people who responded to this invitation and came from various
			districts, where the revival spirit was active, were to be given free boarding and lodging
			during their fifteen days of stay at the retreat. Now there was need also for a suitable
			place where such a large group could be accommodated.</p>

			<p>The Lord also wanted the first retreat to be held at Kakinada. There was
			a large number of people who were converted as the outcome of the revival which had broken
			out in Kakinada, and they needed to be strengthened with the Word of God. These local
			people could also return to their own homes at night deriving great profit from the
			retreat, sharing in the meetings of the day.</p>

			<p>Being wholly occupied with fresh outbreaks of revival, Bro. Daniel had
			written to some of his former colleagues, to attend to the preliminary arrangements which
			needed to be set in motion in preparation for the retreat. But everything seemed to be so
			nebulous and the undertaking so vast in scope, without even a clear indication as to how
			many would be present at the Retreat, or what the whole operation would cost, that these
			old friends of Bro. Daniel scarcely had the requisite courage and faith to execute his
			wishes. Deep in their thinking no doubt could have been the ever present human reasoning,
			&quot;Who will supply the money for so vast undertaking&quot; If it were a wedding, the
			reception and the related events would be over in a day, but this gathering had to be fed
			and taken care of for fifteen days. Nor could Bro. Daniel send the whole sum of money that
			was required for the foodstuff to be purchased and all the other expenses involved in
			advance. The money required had to be prayed in and sometimes the Lord sent the money in,
			for just one day at a time.</p>

			<p>The Canadian Mission authorities very kindly put their training school
			building and the attached boarding school at the disposal of Bro. Daniel. There were
			several school-rooms and ample accommodation for people. Moreover this was the training
			school where Bro. Daniel had once been the Headmaster for a short time and Mrs. Daniel a
			teacher for many years. So the place had many hallowed memories. Within the compound walls
			of this institution, was also situated the tiny cottage, where Bro. Daniel and his family
			had first lived and from where also he had set out, obeying God&#146;s call, without any
			human guarantee or security that his needs and those of his family would be met.</p>

			<p>Thus, when Mr. Daniel arrived, a little before the retreat was due to
			commence, there was little evidence of any necessary preparations having been made. He
			prayerfully went to work and in a short time everything was ready, to receive the incoming
			people.</p>

			<p>Almost the first to arrive at the retreat were two farm labourers, both
			of whom were named Isaac. They appeared to be great in brawn but their education was
			minimal, scarcely having been to school. But they were both men of faith and prayer,
			having been wholly transformed by the power of God. The 250 kilometres which they covered
			by train, was such a phenomenal distance to them, who were so poor, that it must have
			appeared almost like a trans-continental journey to them.</p>

			<p>Then came others, some who were teachers and others who could scarcely
			speak their mother-tongue aright, but with the pronounced rustic accents of remote
			regions. Quite a number of them seemed to be simple and untutored villagers, but oh how
			these men could pray. Soon the place was alive with people.</p>

			<p>The present writer's share in the work, before the retreat commenced,
			was principally to receive the people, help them with their luggage, take down their names
			and guide them to their rooms.</p>

			<p>Those who were resident in the first retreat were no more than 120
			people. During the first retreat, we could do therefore with the small tile-roofed
			entrance hall of this boarding school for our meeting place. No special pandals were put
			up, nor any elaborate arrangements made.</p>

			<p>Great power from God accompanied the preaching of His Word. Much of the
			preaching responsibility fell upon Bro. Daniel. Teaching the Word of God was interspersed
			with seasons of prayer. The seasons of prayer were electric, free, spontaneous and
			spirit-led.</p>

			<p>Child-like simplicity and an unfaltering trust in God's Word,
			scintillated from the lives and even the faces of the people and when they stood up to
			testify to what God had done for them, people were simply spellbound by the naked power
			that God had released in these early converts of the revival. These untutored men had met
			God and the narration of God's work in their places and surroundings sounded like the
			incidents from the Book of Acts. Although some spoke in the broad dialect of those regions
			touched by the revival, this did not distract from the thrill and challenge which their
			testimony brought to the whole audience. There were accounts of miraculous healings,
			conversion of derelicts and drunkards and even the dead being raised to life again, in
			answer to prayer, was witnessed too. One could not sit in the meetings without one's
			spirit being stirred and their faith being strengthened. In the face of these testimonies,
			the present writer even wondered whether he had a testimony at all: so small did he feel
			and so deeply humbled.</p>

			<p>After the meetings, people could be heard scattered over a wide area,
			singly or in small groups, pouring out their hearts to God. God was speaking and working,
			new promises were being received. God was preparing men and women for new spiritual
			advances in their areas and for fresh out-pourings of revival. It was as if the whole
			company was closeted with God.</p>

			<p>There was no evidence of superficial excitement, enervating emotionalism
			or any craving for display or publicity. Everything was perfectly controlled and
			synchronized smoothly with the principal object of the retreat, namely, to see His glory
			and be renewed in the spirit.</p>

			<p>Mrs. Daniel and some of the local ladies supervised the kitchen and
			adequate food was provided, without cost, at the three meals that were served each day.</p>

			<p>A handful of men who had come to the retreat without true conversion
			that is they had come out of religious enthusiasm, than with the experience of spiritual
			birth, were dealt with powerfully by the spirit of God. It was the duty of the present
			writer to take them apart to the room where he spent the greater part of the day in prayer
			and to lead them to true repentance and forgiveness of sins. So freely was God's spirit at
			work, that these men would make full confession of their sins, without any pressure being
			applied, repent and receive a very definite assurance from the Lord. All this would not
			take time either, it was all so spontaneous. God would speak to them so clearly too, so
			that from that point several of them went to become soul-winners.</p>

			<p>The heat of the summer in Kakinada is well-known for its severity. But
			the Lord controlled the heat from getting to extreme levels, such that the retreat was not
			disrupted by the sheer exhaustion brought on by unbearable heat. Thus on all hands God was
			in the midst and guided the retreat.</p>


			<h5><a name="1"></a>Further Blessings at the Retreats</h5>

			<p>Revival continued to spread. As revival meetings continued to take place
			in new areas, more and more souls were getting converted. Moreover, some of these newly
			converted men were receiving great power from God and doing mighty works under the
			anointing of the Holy Spirit. Bro. Daniel saw a great danger in young converts, with
			hardly any knowledge of God's Word, launching into intense healing ministry and the
			casting out of devils. He kept warning them they must watch against pride and walk humbly
			with God.</p>

			<p>In India, when a man begins to be used mightily in healing, the people
			almost ascribe divinity to him. Mr. Daniel never favoured exposing the young men to too
			much publicity, before they were well grounded in the word of God, lest Satan should
			overthrow them to the detriment of the whole work of God.</p>

			<p>All these added up to the need for more retreats where men and women
			could be corrected, taught and fed with God's Word and thus trained to serve Him.</p>

			<p>The next two retreats also were held at Kakinada in the same boarding
			school. The number of people present at the retreats kept steadily increasing from year to
			year, with no decline in the intensity of prayer and the great yearnings for the deeper
			things of God, which were generated at the retreats. Many people too were very regular
			from year to year and they would not miss the retreat at any cost.</p>

			<p>A few young students too, who were on the threshold of entering the
			University, were being prepared by God at these retreats to be soul-winners at their
			respective colleges; so that God was laying the groundwork for revival outpourings amongst
			University and High school students also. God kept anointing and fashioning people to be
			instruments of His power and grace, at the retreats. Thus each retreat was followed by a
			new upsurge of blessing and fresh outbreaks of revival.</p>

			<p>Saturday nights were always the nights of fasting and prayer. One
			Saturday night we gathered for prayer in and around a medium-sized tent without side walls
			and there was a tremendous flow of prayer. The Hand of God was upon the people. Prayer on
			such occasions often took the form of prophesying. Men and women were deeply humbled
			before the Lord, for very awe and the reality of His presence which was palpable. In their
			own native tongues, men and women prayed with amazing authority and unction and before
			they rose from prayer, the dawn had broken.</p>

			<p>The last meeting of the day at the retreats would be the family prayer.
			The people would gather in an informal group and were relaxed and happy. Bro. Daniel
			always enjoyed himself immensely at the family prayers. He would call on people to sing in
			their own languages. The hour would be getting late, but the clock never seemed to bother
			Bro. Daniel. He exuded a deep spirit of love and joy and the contagion caught on and there
			would be joy and love and praise to God.</p>

			<p>In closing, a few instructions would be given to facilitate the smooth
			running of the retreat campus and the family prayer would be dismissed after a short
			prayer.</p>

			<p>The ingredient of faith and the exercise of faith, which is so pleasing
			to God was an ever present factor at the retreats. When the first retreat was called for
			by God, the little store of money which Bro. Daniel had kept for the college studies of
			his first two children, was gladly put at the disposal of God and it was exhausted by the
			time the retreat closed. Thus when his first two children were to be admitted in two
			colleges, Bro. Daniel had to exercise faith afresh for their fees.</p>

			<p>In the retreats immediately following the first, the small gifts which
			came in from the people augmented the sums realised by the sale of Bro. Daniel&#146;s
			properties and the retreats were paid for.</p>

			<p>After the first three annual retreats at Kakinada, the Lord had Bro.
			Daniel move the retreat to another place, a hundred miles north of Kakinada, a port city
			by the name of Visakhapatnam.</p>

			<p>At Visakhapatnam it was as if the angels of God had measured out the
			long verandahs of the high school which was used for the retreat. The people who came in
			greater numbers to the two retreats at Vizag, just filled the place to capacity. When they
			sat down to eat their meals in long lines on the verandahs, there was just enough room for
			all of them.</p>

			<p>The evening meetings were open to all and at the evening meetings many
			people of various persuasions began to be blessed. As the word spread of the reality and
			power of God at the meetings, the people kept coming in ever-increasing numbers.</p>

			<p>A deep spirit of prayer and
			a mighty spirit of revelation was a mark of all the annual retreats. It was the Lord
			working and speaking and men could not help but be searched, cleansed and filled with new
			power.</p>

			<p>The sixth retreat was at Samalkot If anything, Samalkot was even a
			hotter place than Kakinada but a pillar of cloud stood over the camp during that retreat.
			It was so noticeable and amazing. The clouds stood until the people left the retreat to
			return to their own places. The very next day the weather turned to a furnace-like heat.</p>

			<p>At all these retreats, people would go out into the wide open spaces and
			give themselves to prayer, until late in the night. Some of these grounds, however, were
			infested by exceedingly venomous creatures such as cobras and scorpions. Yet all through
			those early years and after too, the Lord never permitted any venomous creature, to sting
			or bite His children, who had come to the retreat.</p>

			<p>At a later retreat a fair-sized cobra even crept into the lap of a woman
			who was lost in prayer. When she opened her eyes, here was this unwelcome creature snugly
			curled in the folds of her sari. The Lord kept that praying woman from panicking and the
			cobra slithered away without hurting her.</p>

			<p>Then came the time when the revival blessing began to spread in several
			directions, so that the retreat had to be moved to a central location, like Madras, which
			is easily accessible to people from all regions. Thereafter, Madras became the venue of
			the annual retreat. It was at one of the early retreats that Bro. Daniel preached through
			the whole retreat at the morning sessions, on that verse of scripture, so important for
			spiritual growth, namely, Romans 12:2 &quot;And be not conformed to this world: but be ye
			transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and
			acceptable, and perfect, will of God.&quot;</p>

			<p>The teaching of doing the will of God, which Bro. Daniel had learnt from
			a whole lifetime of discipleship, was very precious and necessary for the young disciples,
			to save them from the danger of settling down to selfish, carnal and self-chosen paths of
			ease. Bro. Daniel would literally be caught up into a halo of heavenly atmosphere as he
			expounded how the Spirit of the Lord taught him to seek and do God's will at all costs.
			The oft times ununderstood distinction between the permissive will of God, which is all
			that a man does, when he has set his heart on a particular course of action, and the
			perfect will of God, which is the course most pleasing to God, was explained clearly to
			the people. Hence many in the Fellowship, from the start, learnt the secret of doing God's
			will. They would not rush head-long, choose a pleasing and reasonable course of action,
			meet with failure and then repine over the years that so much well-meaning labour was
			lost. The people were taught to stand still and let God speak to them first, before
			setting out on any venture or project. Hence seeking God's will earnestly, waiting
			patiently for the revelation and doing the perfect will of God, however costly and
			inconvenient it may be, became the chief rule of life, to most people in the Fellowship.
			This naturally eliminated much wastage, heart-ache, loss of time and money. Thus treading
			in the will of God, even greater victories began to be won. Thus, wherever the work
			spread, there were the elements of steady growth, unswerving trust in the promises of God
			and steadfastness to the cause set before them.</p>

			<p>The first of the retreats at Madras was held at Gurukul Theological
			College in Kilpauk. While the permission to hand the buildings over for the retreat was
			granted to us on paper, Bro. Daniel's faith was tried until the last moment, for the keys
			of the place were not handed over to him, until the day before the retreat commenced. Thus
			the time at disposal of the small team of young students, to clean and prepare the place
			for the retreat was very short.</p>

			<p>It was with hearts of thanksgiving that the young people went to work
			and quickly readied the place for the large number of people who were expected. The only
			vehicle of the Fellowship at that time, was a hand-drawn rickshaw which had been presented
			to the Fellowship, which had painted on its body, the Scripture &quot;Every good gift and
			perfect gift is from above&quot;. James 1:1 7. The big vessels that were used for cooking
			rice etc., were piled on this rickshaw and one of the young, recently converted college
			boys drew the rickshaw* triumphantly, to the venue of the retreat. In a country where the
			social distance between the poor rickshaw-puller and the well-to-do college student is
			very great, this surely presented a pretty sight !</p>

			<p>* Hand-drawn rickshaw can hardly be seen anymore, in India.</p>

			<p>When the retreat in Madras in the month of May, became a well
			established annual feature of the work, then came the unprecedented drought year of 1952.
			The reservoirs that supplied the city's water were partly drying up and the Corporation of
			Madras was frantically trying to dig wells. The schools and colleges were advised to close
			early for the Summer vacation and people were leaving the city of Madras.</p>

			<p>At that retreat, a little over three hundred people were expected. The
			Meston College, Royapettah, Madras, was chosen as the venue of the retreat that year.
			Knowledgeable people were not a little amazed that Bro. Daniel should choose to call for
			such a large number of people to the city at a time when the scarcity of water was so
			acute. In the height of the Indian summer or in mid-May, two baths a day is almost a
			minimal requirement, if one should choose not to be malodorous. But where was the water to
			be found?</p>

			<p>Soon after the retreat commenced, at the very first fasting prayer
			session, the much-needed rain was made a subject of prayer. The Seasonal rains or the
			Monsoon rains are only to be expected in Madras, at the end of October. Thus there was
			simply no prospect of any real precipitation. &quot;Prayer changes things&quot;, was not
			just a nice sounding motto on the wall for those present at the retreat. Practically all
			of them had made the transition from the dull &quot;saying of prayers&quot; to real and
			robust praying. The prayer season closed in the middle of the night and the ground sheets
			on which the people had been kneeling in prayer, were being folded and removed from the
			open, where they had met, when the first drops of rainfall began to fall. When the morning
			broke, the thought foremost on the mind was, &quot;The raindrops of the night, were they
			just a passing shower?&quot; One did not have to think long. The downpour was strong and
			incessant and the skies were very dark. It rained and it rained, until it was becoming
			difficult to wade through the rain water even to the meeting hall in the campus. The
			improvised kitchen too was having many problems to keep the firewood dry and the fires
			burning. Thus Bro. Daniel was told, &quot;You prayed for cats and dogs to be rained down.
			Now there is too much rain. Won&#146;t you please pray that it should stop?&quot; The rain
			gauges recorded a phenomenal 18 inches* rain -- a record rainfall for the month of May,
			for all-time, city streets were flooded and the water shortage was instantly solved.</p>

			<p>*46 centimetres</p>

			<p>The last retreats of Bro. Daniel's lifetime, were held in the campus of
			the Fellowship itself. Adequate booths were put up for the continually increasing number
			of people and the blessing too at the retreats kept mounting.</p>

			<p>It was at one of the last few retreat meetings that one morning, Bro.
			Daniel who was normally not given to emotional appeals or display of over-much emotion, on
			the platform, broke down in the midst of his message and wept saying, &quot;Where is glory
			for the Lord Jesus in this land?&quot; There were not many in the congregation who could
			contain themselves at this point in the meeting and nearly everyone broke down with this
			heart-cry uppermost in their minds, &quot;Lord, manifest forth your glory: be Thou
			glorified&quot;.</p>
